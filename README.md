# DSA-Patterns
A comprehensive resource covering all patterns of DSA, including Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, BSTs, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. Provides detailed explanations for every scenario, along with key insights to help you tackle new problems effectively. Includes pattern-wise problem sets for structured practice.
# Arrays
## Two Pointers
***Scenario***: Look for problems where you need to iterate through the array with two pointers, typically starting from different ends or positions within the array. - Consider tasks that involve comparing or manipulating elements from two different parts of the array simultaneously.

***Clue***: Look for problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of the array.
> Problems
- 2 sum
- 3 sum
- 3 sum closest
- 3 sum smaller
- 4 sum
- Remove duplicates from sorted array
- Squares of a sorted array
- Number of arithmetic triplets
- Minimum sum of maountain triplets I
- Minimum sum of maountain triplets II
## Merge Intervals
***Scenario***: Identify problems involving intervals or ranges of values, such as time intervals, scheduling, or overlapping events. - Look for tasks where you need to combine or compare intervals, merge overlapping intervals, or find intersections between them.

***Clue***: Look for problems where the input involves intervals represented as pairs of start and end points, and the task revolves around combining or manipulating these intervals.
> Problems
- Merge Intervals
- Insert Interval
- Non-overlapping Intervals
- Interval List Intersections
## Sorting
***Scenario***: Consider problems where arranging elements in a specific order can simplify searching, counting, or comparing elements efficiently. - Look for tasks where sorting elements according to certain criteria can lead to a solution or optimize subsequent operations.

***Clue***: Look for problems mentioning that the array needs to be sorted first or hints that sorting might facilitate the solution process.
> Problems
- Sort Colors
- Meeting Rooms II
- Largest Number
- Wiggle Sort II
- Merge Sorted Array
## Sliding Window
***Scenario***: Identify problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings where you need to maintain a window of elements and slide it across the array. - Look for tasks where you need to track a subset of elements within the array that satisfies specific conditions.

***Clue***: Look for problems involving contiguous subarrays, hints that a "window" needs to slide through the array, or mention of properties like "maximum sum" or "minimum length."
> Problems
- Minimum Size Sub-Array Sum
- Longest Mountain in Array
- Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
- Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards
- Maximum Product Sub-Array
