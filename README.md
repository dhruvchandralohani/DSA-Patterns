# DSA-Patterns
A comprehensive resource covering all patterns of DSA, including Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, BSTs, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. Provides detailed explanations for every scenario, along with key insights to help you tackle new problems effectively. Includes pattern-wise problem sets for structured practice.
# Arrays
## Two Pointers
***Scenario***: Look for problems where you need to iterate through the array with two pointers, typically starting from different ends or positions within the array. - Consider tasks that involve comparing or manipulating elements from two different parts of the array simultaneously.

***Clue***: Look for problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of the array.
> Problems
- 2 sum
- 3 sum
- 3 sum closest
- 3 sum smaller
- 4 sum
- Remove duplicates from sorted array
- Squares of a sorted array
- Number of arithmetic triplets
- Minimum sum of maountain triplets I
- Minimum sum of maountain triplets II
## Merge Intervals
***Scenario***:  Identify problems involving intervals or ranges of values, such as time intervals, scheduling, or overlapping events. - Look for tasks where you need to combine or compare intervals, merge overlapping intervals, or find intersections between them.

***Clue***: Look for problems where the input involves intervals represented as pairs of start and end points, and the task revolves around combining or manipulating these intervals.
> Problems
- Merge Intervals
- Insert Interval
- Non-overlapping Intervals
- Interval List Intersections
