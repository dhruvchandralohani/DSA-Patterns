# DSA-Patterns
A comprehensive resource covering all patterns of DSA, including Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, BSTs, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming. Provides detailed explanations for every scenario, along with key insights to help you tackle new problems effectively. Includes pattern-wise problem sets for structured practice.
# Arrays
## Two Pointers
***Scenario***: Look for problems where you need to iterate through the array with two pointers, typically starting from different ends or positions within the array. - Consider tasks that involve comparing or manipulating elements from two different parts of the array simultaneously.

***Clue***: Look for problem descriptions mentioning a sorted array or the need to compare elements from both ends of the array.
> Problems
